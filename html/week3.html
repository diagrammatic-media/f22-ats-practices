<h2>Week 3: Variables and For Loops</h2>
<p>Goals for the week of 2/14/22:</p>
<ol>
<li>Say hello & check-in (take attendance!)
<li>Share and Discuss <code>Coding Sketch #2</code>
<li>Clarify or Demo any coding concepts unclear from <code>Coding Sketch #2</code> (break)
<li>Intro Interactivity: Mouse clicks, drags, and mobile touch gestures
<li>Start work on <code>Coding Sketch #3</code>
</ol>

<h3>Homework</h3>
<h4>Readings</h4>
<p>Prepare and Code along: <b>Getting Started with p5.js // Chapters 4: Variables</b></p>
<p>Review and fiddle with in-class code example. Comment and uncomment the different steps to see how <code>for loops</code> structure drawing in space. See how <code>variables</code> such as <code>rand, concent, drawProb</code> and the <code>random</code> function interact  to control different kinds of variation.</p>

<h5>Part 1: Vera Molnar Art Imitation</h5>
<p>Create an imitation of the <b>ONE of TWO</b> of the Vera Molnar works above. You will need to use nested <code>for loops</code> to iterate through shapes, as well as the <code>random</code> function to introduce variation.</p>

<p>Here is some <a href = "https://editor.p5js.org/gjohns13-spectacular/sketches/38jUV3uoD">starting code</a> which may be helpful since it starts with a few handy variables already declared.</p>

<h5>Part 2: Creative Riff</h5>

<p>Part 1 will be challenging. But afterwards you'll have a solid framework for making something of your own. Let's have some fun with it! Make sure you've saved your first copy, and then duplicate your sketch. Now, how can you use this nested <code>for loop</code> concept to create your own work? What other features (color, stroke, stroke weight, etc.) can you use to change the look and feel of this piece? How can randomness make a return and enliven the feel?</p>

<h5>Tips for success</h5>
<p>Don't try to do everything at once. Break things down. Follow these steps below if it is helpful.
<ul>
  <li>Before you get started, open your p5 editor and the <a href ="../pdf/gettingstarted.pdf">Getting Started"</a> text. Work through Chapter 4, example by example. This seems tedious, but it will build up comprehension.
    <li>When you're ready to begin the code sketch: First, draw a shape. Familiarize yourself with what arguments do what. For the left example, you will need to use <code>quad()</code>. For the right, you will need to use <code>line()</code>. How many arguments do you need? What does what?
    <li>Now, create a row of shapes with a <code>for loop</code> inside your <code>draw loop</code>. Insert your shape code into the <code>for loop</code> and use the loop's variable (i or s or whatever you choose) to <b>multiply</b> the x value and push it to the right.

      <li>Not sure what this means? Check the reference. Watch the videos below. Read the section in the book on <code>for loop</code> again -- you'll see this in action!
<li>Then, put that <code>for loop</code> inside a new <code>for loop</code>. Make sure the new loop has a different variable than the first. Use this variable to alter the y position of the shape (use multiplication again), and hence to draw consecutive rows at different heights in the Canvas. Get this working before you move on!
  <li>Finally, you'll need to use the <code>random()</code> function to introduce variation to the code. What elements are randomized? What is the range of randomization? How will you use arithmetic to integrate the random number into your shape's coordinates? Now is a good time to insert <code>noLoop()</code> into your code so that you are only getting one drawing per "play".
    <li>Still stuck? Email your prof and ask for a quick appointment to talk through the issue. Check the reference and other materials. Phone a friend in your group and see if they are stuck too.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h5>In-Class Demo</h5>
<p>In class during week 2, I stepped through imitating another of Vera Molnar's work. You will find video on your learning management system (either Canvas or Moodle). You may also use the <a href = "https://editor.p5js.org/gjohns13-spectacular/sketches/38jUV3uoD">starting code</a> and code along with this before adapting it to the assignment.</p>
