<h2>Group Presentations</h2>
<p>In groups, you will prepare a 30-minute presentation on one of three topics:
INTERACTIVITY (week 4), INTERFACE (week 9), or NETWORK (week 13). Groups will
be organized in Week 2.</p>
<h3>Close Reading</h3>
<p>For 10 minutes, you will present the relevant chapter from New Media: The Key
Concepts. This "close reading" should ground your presentation, creating a framework for understanding the artwork that comes later. While reading, ask yourself:
<ul>
  <li>What keywords help us understand this concept?
  <li>What are key examples of this phenomenon?
    <li>How do the authors structure the chapter? why do they do that?
      <li>How do we encounter this in our lives? What is its importance to our contemporary lived experience?
</ul>

</p>

<p>For these presentations, you will need to read from <b><a href = "../pdf/newmedia.pdf">New Media: The Key Concepts</a></b> from Nicholas Gane and David Beer.</p>

<h3>Artwork</h3>
<p>For the second 10 minutes, you will present an artwork related to this concept. In your presentation on the artwork, you are expected to do independent research. Each of these works has ample information online. If you are having trouble finding relevant information to narrativize and contextualize the work and the artist, please ask the instructor.</p>


<h3>Discussion</h3>
<p>For the final 10 minutes, your group should prepare a set of discussion questions and lead
the class in discussion. Time to open things up. How can you engage your fellow students as burgeoning artists, or folks interested in art making? How can you engage their experiences with technology? Can you make it a bit fun?</p>

<p>Please see the rubric in your syllabus for the grading rubric. Below are outlines of each of the three topics.</p>



<h3>INTERACTIVITY</h3>
<h4>Week 4: February 22</h4>
<p>What is meant by interactivity? Who is interacting with what? and how? What kinds of interactivity does digital media provide that analog media do now? what about television, radio, books, or newspapers? How can art leverage these interactive affordance? explore them and problematize them?</p>

<h3>INTERFACE</h3>
<h4>Week 9: March 29</h4>
<p>Where does the machine begin and the human end? How do we translate between the human and our taps, swipes, speech, and touch -- and the computer with its operating systems, encoded procedures, and binary representations? The interface is the site of that transition. How can we work with computers to imagine new expressive interfaces?</p>

<h3>NETWORK</h3>
<h4>Week 13: (April 26 or May 3, depending on your class schedule. It is same week that Coding Sketch 8 is due.)</h4>
<p>Built on infrastructural networks, web technologies have afforded us access to nodes all over the world. How does the network -- as a technology and as a figure of thought -- inform and enrich art practice?</p>
