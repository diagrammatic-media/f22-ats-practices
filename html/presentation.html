<h2>Group Presentations</h2>
<p>In groups, you will prepare a 30-minute presentation on one of three topics:
INTERACTIVITY (week 4), INTERFACE (week 9), or NETWORK (week 13). Groups will
be organized in Week 2.</p>
<p>For 10 minutes, you will present the relevant chapter from New Media: The Key
Concepts. For 10 minutes, you will present an artwork related to this concept. For the
final ten minutes, your group should prepare a set of discussion questions and lead
the class in discussion.</p>

<p>Please see the rubric in your syllabus for the grading rubric. Below are outlines of each of the three topics.</p>
<p>For these presentations, you will need to read from <b><a href = "../pdf/newmedia.pdf">New Media: The Key Concepts</a></b> from Nicholas Gane and David Beer.</p>

<h3>INTERACTIVITY</h3>
<h4>Week 4: February 22</h4>
<p>What is meant by interactivity? Who is interacting with what? and how? What kinds of interactivity does digital media provide that analog media do now? what about television, radio, books, or newspapers? How can art leverage these interactive affordance? explore them and problematize them?</p>

<h3>INTERFACE</h3>
<h4>Week 9: March 29</h4>
<p>Where does the machine begin and the human end? How do we translate between the human and our taps, swipes, speech, and touch -- and the computer with its operating systems, encoded procedures, and binary representations? The interface is the site of that transition. How can we work with computers to imagagine new expressive interfaces?</p>
