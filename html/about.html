  <h2>About this class</h2>
<h3>What?</h3>
  <p>The bulk of this course is will be teaching teach some basic programming skills. We'll use a programming environment called p5*js. p5 is a version of <a href = "https://processingfoundation.org/">Processing</a>, a toolkit made for artists by artists. p5 is technically a <code>library</code> for the programming language JavaScript. One nice thing you will soon discover is that JavaScript is used in programming for the web, and so it will be very easy for us to share our creations with other.</p>
<h3>When?</h3>
<p>This class will meet Tuesdays. As your instructor, I will work to make space in class for you to get started on your assignments. However (!), you'll need to create time in your weekly schedule to work on the readings and assignments for this class. Programming is a challenging skill and requires practice -- like playing an instrument or practicing a sport. What will your routine look like? Late Thursday nights, drum and bass in the headphones, tucked into a library corner? Or Sunday afternoon with a cup of coffee or tea, and lofi chill beats? Make time and space for these assignments and not only will you succeed in the class, your abilities will support your expressive ambitions in impressive ways.</p>
<h3>Where?</h3>
<p>This class will meet online through Zoom during our scheduled meeting time.</p>
<p>Office hours will also take place on Zoom.</p>
<p>Your final exhibition will be a web exhibition you can share with your friends.</p>
<h3>How?</h3>
<p>This site will outline each week and assign a reading and a code sketch. You will submit your code sketch on your course's learning management system. The text is <b><a href = "../pdf/gettingstarted.pdf">Getting Started with p5*js</a></b> by Lauren McCarthy, Ben Fry, and Casey Reas. I highly recommend purchasing a physical copy since much of this class will involve staring at a screen. Otherwise, you can find inexpensive (<$10) eBook versions online.</p>
